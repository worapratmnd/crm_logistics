# Story 2.3: Protected Routes

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to ensure that only logged-in users can access the main application pages,
**so that** our business data is secure.

### Project Structure Requirements

[Source: architecture/7-unified-project-structure.md]

- **App Router:** Main routing logic in `apps/web/src/App.tsx` (already exists)
- **Protected Components:** Enhanced route protection components within src/components/
- **Authentication Context:** `apps/web/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (already exists)
- **Navigation Components:** MainLayout and routing components in `apps/web/src/components/layouts/`
- **Shared Types:** User interface and roles from `packages/shared/types.ts`

### Current Implementation Analysis

Based on existing App.tsx from Story 2.2:

- **ProtectedRoute Component:** Basic implementation exists with isAuthenticated check
- **Route Structure:** Nested route setup with MainLayout wrapper for protected areas
- **Authentication Integration:** useAuth hook integration implemented
- **Loading States:** Basic spinner implemented for authentication checks
- **Navigation Logic:** Basic redirect to /login for unauthenticated users

### Enhanced Protection Requirements

Story 2.3 expansion needs:

- **Comprehensive Authentication Checks:** Enhanced validation beyond basic isAuthenticated
- **Return URL Handling:** Preserve intended destination for post-login redirect
- **Role-Based Route Access:** Implement permission-based route access control
- **Session State Management:** Handle real-time authentication state changes
- **Deep Link Security:** Secure handling of direct URL access to protected routes
- **Navigation Guards:** Prevent unauthorized programmatic navigation

### Authentication State Integration

[Source: Story 2.2 AuthContext implementation]

Required authentication state features for route protection:

- **isAuthenticated:** Boolean authentication status
- **user:** Current user object with role information
- **loading:** Authentication check loading state
- **error:** Authentication error state
- **hasRole():** Method for role-based access control
- **canAccess():** Method for permission-based route access

### File Locations

Based on project structure and existing implementation:

- **Enhanced App Component:** `apps/web/src/App.tsx` (existing, needs enhancement)
- **ProtectedRoute Component:** Extract to `apps/web/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- **Route Guards:** `apps/web/src/components/auth/RouteGuards.tsx` (new)
- **Auth Utilities:** Enhance `apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` (existing)
- **Navigation Security:** Enhance `apps/web/src/components/layouts/MainLayout.tsx`

### Route Protection Strategy

Security implementation approach:

- **Public Routes:** /login (accessible without authentication)
- **Protected Routes:** /, /customers, /jobs (require authentication)
- **Role-Based Routes:** Future admin routes (require specific roles)
- **Fallback Handling:** Unauthorized access redirects to /login with return URL
- **Session Validation:** Real-time authentication state checks

### URL and Navigation Security

[Source: architecture/8-development-workflow.md patterns]

Required security features:

- **Return URL Preservation:** Store intended destination before login redirect
- **URL Validation:** Sanitize and validate redirect URLs for security
- **Deep Link Support:** Handle direct browser navigation to protected routes
- **History Management:** Secure browser history handling for authenticated navigation
- **Cross-Tab Synchronization:** Authentication state sync across browser tabs

### Testing Requirements

Testing approach for route protection:

- **Route Access Tests:** Verify authenticated vs unauthenticated access
- **Redirect Logic Tests:** Test proper redirects for different scenarios
- **Authentication State Tests:** Test route behavior during auth state changes
- **Role-Based Access Tests:** Verify role-based route protection
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end authentication and navigation flow

### Integration with Existing Components

- **MainLayout:** Navigation security and authenticated user display
- **Sidebar Navigation:** Active route highlighting and permission-based menu items
- **AuthContext:** Real-time authentication state management
- **LoginPage:** Return URL handling for post-authentication redirect
- **Page Components:** Authentication state awareness for data loading

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/8-development-workflow.md security standards]

Security best practices for route protection:

- **Client-Side Security:** User experience protection (not primary security layer)
- **Session Validation:** Real-time session validation with Supabase
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** Secure communication for all authentication flows
- **XSS Prevention:** Proper URL sanitization and validation
- **CSRF Protection:** Secure state management for navigation

### Performance Optimization

Route protection performance considerations:

- **Authentication Checks:** Minimize redundant authentication state checks
- **Loading States:** Smooth UX during authentication verification
- **Route Caching:** Efficient route matching and protection logic
- **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of authentication listeners
- **Bundle Optimization:** Code splitting for authentication-related components

### Edge Case Handling

Special scenarios to handle:

- **Session Expiration:** Handle session timeout during protected route navigation
- **Concurrent Sessions:** Multiple browser tabs with different authentication states
- **Network Issues:** Graceful degradation during network connectivity problems
- **Authentication Failures:** Handle authentication service errors gracefully
- **Browser Refresh:** Maintain authentication state across page refreshes

### Future Story Integration Preparation

This story prepares for upcoming authentication features:

- **Logout Functionality (Story 2.4):** Route protection will integrate with logout flows
- **User Profile Management:** Protected routes for user account management
- **Admin Features:** Role-based route protection for administrative functions
- **API Integration:** Protected routes that load user-specific data securely

## Testing

## Project Structure Notes

Story requirements align with the defined project structure and extend the existing authentication implementation from Story 2.2. The enhanced route protection will build upon the existing ProtectedRoute component and AuthContext integration. No conflicts identified between story requirements and existing project architecture. The implementation will maintain backward compatibility with current routing structure while adding enhanced security features.
